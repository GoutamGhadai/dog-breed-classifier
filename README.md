### Project Motivation

This project aims at classifing the dog breeds based on images given to it. 
It first successfully detect the human faces and the dog faces from the images.
Then it uses a pre-trained VGG16 Net to find the predicted class for a given image.

## Project Overview

In this project, Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
